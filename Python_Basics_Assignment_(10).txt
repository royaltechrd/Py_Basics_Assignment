file=[]

# TO go through in the Directory, we use os.walk method:
#It will go to  root,each dir , each File present in the given path i.e. src

for (root, dirs, files) in os.walk(src, topdown=True):

    for i in files :

            file.append(i)
            if not i in file:
                #pathlib.Path() will give the Path and root, i will concatenate in PathFormat
                
		filepath=pathlib.Path(root,i)
                print(str(filepath))
                
		# It will copy the file content and paste to the Destination Path.
