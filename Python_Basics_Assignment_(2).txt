	not (5 > 4)	     		     -Value = False
	(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)    	 	     -Value = True

	(True and True) and (True == False)  -Value = False

Q.No.5
Ans.5: Comparison Operator are given Below:
	a) Less than ">"		b) Greater than "<"		
	c) Equal to "=="		d) Greater than equal to ">="		
	e) Less than equal to "<="	f) Not Equal to "!=" 

Q.No.6
And.6:  The main difference between the equal to operator and assigment operator is that 
	equal to is having double = i.e."==" while in case of assignment operator it is simply
	"=".
	For example:-Lets say you have a variable x
	And you want to put String "Shrangarika" in x, then you will use assignment operator
	x="Shrangarika"
	while equal to is used to compare like
	if x="Shrangarika":
		print("He is my ex")


Q.No.7
Ans.7: I Block :-

	if spam==10:
	print("eggs")

	II Block :-
	
	if spam>5:
	print("bacon")
	else:
	print("ham")

	III Block :-
	
	print("spam")

Q.No.8
And.8:  spam=(input("Please Enter anything"))
	if int(spam)==1:
       	  print("hello")
	elif int(spam)==2:
	  print("howdy")
	else:
	  print("Good Morning")

Ans.9:  Press  Ctrl+F2 to Stop the Program

		
Q.No.10
Ans.10: Break keep the pointer out of the loop while continue used to go to at the start
	of the loop without executing the code followed by continue.

Q.No.11
Ans.11:	In range(10), It is giving a set of number from 0 to 9 i.e. except the Upper Bound..
	In range(0,10), it is giving the set of number from lower bound ie. 0 to 
	Upper Bound-1 i.e. Lefting out the Upper Bound Number.
	In range(0,10,1) It is giving set of numbers that go from lower bound to upper bound 
	by lefting out the upper bound and by adding each number by 1
	

Q.No.12
Ans.12: Via For Loop  
	for i in range(1,11):
	   print(i)

	Via While Loop:
	i=1
	while i<11:
	 print(i)
	 i+=1

Q.No.13
